    width: min(100% - 40px, 1000px); //Will select the smallest value. This means the screen won't be more than 1000px because that will be the maximum size and if it's a mobile viewport, then it will be 100% of that window, which will be obviously smaller than 1000px. -40px is to add a bit of space between the border
    margin-inline: auto; //(!!!!) margin-inline = margin: 0 auto; but the benefit is we don't have to define margin bottom and top to 0 now.Will make sure they are center for very large screens as well
